## Game Overview

In this game, you'll control a turtle character trying to cross a busy street. Here's how the game works:

- **Turtle**: The player controls a turtle that starts at the bottom of the screen.
- **Cars**: Randomly generated cars come from the right side of the screen, and the player must avoid them.
- **Levels**: Each time the turtle successfully crosses the street, the level increases and the speed of the cars increases as well.

## File Structure

This project consists of the following files:

- **main.py**: The main game loop that initializes the game and handles user input.
- **player.py**: Defines the `Player` class for the turtle character.
- **car_manager.py**: Manages the generation and movement of the cars.
- **scoreboard.py**: Displays the current level and handles game-over messaging.

## Keeping All Files Organized

To ensure the game runs smoothly, it's important to keep all the project files organized in a single folder. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. **Create a Project Folder**: 
   - Name it something like `turtle_crossing_game`.

2. **Place All Files in the Folder**:
   - Move or copy the following files into your project folder:
     - `main.py`
     - `player.py`
     - `car_manager.py`
     - `scoreboard.py`

3. **Directory Structure**:
   - Your project folder should look like this:
     ```
     turtle_crossing_game/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player.py
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ car_manager.py
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scoreboard.py
     ```

4. **Running the Game**:
   - Navigate to your project folder in the terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/turtle_crossing_game
     ```
   - Execute the main file:
